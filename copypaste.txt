Core Benefits

1. Immediate Liquidity
Life insurance provides tax-free cash to beneficiaries, which can cover funeral costs, debts, and estate taxes. This avoids the need to sell other assets like a family business or real estate.

2. Estate Tax Reduction
For estates exceeding the federal exemption limit, estate taxes can significantly reduce what heirs receive. By placing the policy in an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT), the death benefit is excluded from the taxable estate.

3. Equalizing Inheritances
If certain assets are hard to divide, such as a business or property, life insurance can provide equal value to other heirs. For example, one child may inherit the business while others receive insurance payouts.

4. Funding Special Needs Trusts
Life insurance can support a dependent with special needs, ensuring their long-term care without disrupting government benefits.

Common Life Insurance Strategies

Using Permanent Policies for Living Benefits

Permanent life insurance builds tax-deferred cash value that can be used while you are alive.
	•	Access Cash Value: You can take out tax-free loans or withdrawals to fund college tuition, retirement income, or emergency needs.
	•	Use as Collateral: The cash value can help secure loans or better interest rates with banks.

Utilizing Trusts for Tax Efficiency
	•	Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)
An ILIT removes the policy’s death benefit from your taxable estate. You can gift cash to the trust or transfer an existing policy. The trust owns the policy, keeping it separate from your estate.
	•	Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)
A SLAT allows one spouse to benefit from the policy during their lifetime. After their death, the trust passes the assets to heirs without being included in the taxable estate.

What to Consider When Building Your Plan

Consult Professionals
Work with a financial advisor, estate planning attorney, and tax consultant. Estate planning is complex and requires tailored advice.

Start Early
Life insurance is more affordable when you are young and healthy. Starting early allows more time to build cash value and secure better terms.

Review and Update Regularly
Family dynamics, financial goals, and tax laws change. Review your policies, beneficiary designations, and estate plans to ensure alignment with your current situation.
