Civil Case Roadmap – Breach of Contract (Contractor Dispute)

⚖️ Important: An attorney must handle filing and court appearances. This is just an outline of what typically happens.

⸻

Step 1. File the Complaint
	•	Attorney files Complaint (lawsuit) with the court and serves the contractor with the Summons.
	•	This officially starts the case.

⸻

Step 2. Wait for Defendant’s Response
	•	The contractor has 20–30 days (depends on state) to respond.

If they do nothing:
➡️ Attorney files a Motion for Default Judgment (ask court to award you the money immediately).

If they file an Answer (deny allegations):
➡️ Case moves to discovery (both sides exchange documents).

If they file a Motion to Dismiss:
➡️ Attorney responds with legal arguments to keep the case alive.

⸻

Step 3. Discovery Stage
	•	Both sides must share evidence (texts, receipts, proof of payment).
	•	If contractor refuses to cooperate:
➡️ Attorney files a Motion to Compel Discovery to force them to hand over evidence.

⸻

Step 4. Pre-Trial Motions
	•	After discovery, attorney reviews facts.

If evidence is clear (you paid $10k, no work done):
➡️ Attorney files a Motion for Summary Judgment (ask judge to rule now without trial).

If case goes to trial:
➡️ Attorney files Motions in Limine to block irrelevant or prejudicial evidence.

⸻

Step 5. Trial (if necessary)
	•	If summary judgment is denied, the case is decided at trial.
	•	Attorney presents your texts, payment proof, and testimony.

⸻

Summary Flow
	1.	Complaint filed → Defendant has deadline to respond.
	2.	No response → Default Judgment.
	3.	Response → Discovery.
	4.	If stonewalling → Motion to Compel.
	5.	If facts are clear → Motion for Summary Judgment.
	6.	If trial happens → Motions in Limine.
