How to Pretend This Is an Espresso Shot
A step-by-step guide to caffeinated self-deception

Step 1: Lower Your Standards
Close your eyes. Picture a real espresso… crema, aroma, dignity.
Now erase that. You’re about to drink powdered sadness.

Step 2: Open Instant Espresso
Tear dramatically, as if you’re unsealing a top-secret mission from corporate HQ.
Try not to inhale the aroma. It smells like compromise.

Step 3: Use the Smallest Cup You Can Find
Bonus points if it looks like it belongs to a dollhouse.
The goal: delusion through portion control.

Step 4: Add Hot Water, but Not Too Much
You’re not making a drink. You’re crafting a concentrated lie.
Think “espresso shot,” not “despair soup.”

Step 5: Stir Vigorously
Whisk like your will to live depends on it.
The froth won’t come, but the tears might.

Step 6: Slam It Like a Real Shot
Don’t sip. Don’t savor. Just shoot.
And if you wince? That’s flavor… allegedly.

Step 7: Lie to Yourself
Say it with me:
“Mmm… rich, bold, handcrafted…”

Now get back to work.

Note: Side effects may include:
	•	Sudden nostalgia for the broken espresso machine  
	•	Existential questions  
	•	Googling “office-friendly espresso alternatives” during meetings
