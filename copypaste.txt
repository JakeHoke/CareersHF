One year ago today, on a hot July afternoon much like this one, my twin brother Tyler Hoke and I were at a campaign rally when chaos broke out. We had only decided to go the week prior, a last-minute choice that placed us at the center of an event that would make national headlines.

It was a moment that shifted everything in seconds and served as a stark reminder of how quickly circumstances can change.

That lesson still holds true not just in the moment, but over time.

This past week, letters were sent to 22 countries regarding potential tariff changes. To many, the list may seem random. But if you look closer, patterns emerge. Twenty of the countries are beneficiaries of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. One, Brazil, is part of BRICS. The only exception? Japan.

Whether deliberate or not, it’s a striking reminder that change can unfold in an instant or build quietly over time sometimes catching the world off guard, other times signaling deeper shifts already in motion.

A lot can change in a moment. Even more can change in a year.

As in my previous posts, if you appreciated the read and want to follow my side quests and randomness, feel free to leave a comment or send me a connection.

And if you’re wondering why the clip in the post features Tyler instead of me, believe me, I’m wondering the same thing.
