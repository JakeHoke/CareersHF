Markets were a bit shaky last week—here’s what you should know (in plain English):

The S&P 500 fell 1.5% last week, continuing a rocky March. But not everything was red.

Winners:

	•	Energy stocks are up 9% year-to-date—oil prices are helping.
	•	Consumer staples (think groceries and essentials) rose 1.7% last week. In uncertain times, people still buy the basics.

Losers:

	•	Tech stocks dropped 3.7% last week and are down over 12% this year. After last year’s big gains, some of that is just a reset.

What does this mean for you?
Volatility is normal. The key is having a diversified plan and staying focused on long-term goals—not short-term headlines.

If you’re unsure whether your investments are positioned well for today’s market, let’s talk.
