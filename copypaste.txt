Local Rules: Every court has unique rules governing pleadings, motions, formatting, deadlines, and service. These templates must be carefully reviewed and adapted by a licensed attorney admitted to practice in the jurisdiction where the case will be filed.
	•	Facts & Evidence: The effectiveness of these documents depends entirely on the underlying facts and evidence, which must be verified and properly presented by counsel. Supporting exhibits (e.g., text messages, receipts, proof of payment) must be attached where required.
	•	Legal Theories: Causes of action and motions described herein (breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, default judgment, discovery motions, summary judgment, motions in limine, protective orders, sanctions, etc.) are general categories. Whether they are available or advisable in this case depends on state law, the judge, and the litigation strategy chosen by counsel.
	•	Risks: Improperly drafted or filed documents may result in dismissal of the case, loss of rights, sanctions, or adverse judgments.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Consult with a licensed attorney before filing anything with the court.
	•	Provide your attorney with these drafts, the supporting evidence (texts, payment proof, correspondence), and a written timeline of events.
	•	Follow your attorney’s guidance as to which motions to file, in what order, and at what stage of the proceedings.

Bottom Line:
These documents are starting points only. They are intended to help you organize the facts and legal theories so that your attorney can efficiently prepare a proper filing tailored to your jurisdiction.
