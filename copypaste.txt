Why audits are conducted
	•	Life changes: Marriage, divorce, business changes, or new family members can shift insurance needs.
	•	Policy performance: Cash value policies fluctuate with interest rates and markets; audits verify they’re on track.
	•	Cost optimization: Can identify ways to reduce premiums or qualify for better rates.
	•	Mitigate fiduciary liability: Helps trustees manage policies in trusts and uncover hidden issues.
	•	Business planning: Ensures policies for buy-sell agreements or key-person coverage remain suitable.
